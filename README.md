# rolling

A collection of efficient rolling/sliding window algorithms for Python.

## Quickstart

Import the `rolling()` function:
```python
>>> from rolling import rolling
```
Now suppose we have this list:
```python
>>> counts = [1, 5, 2, 0, 3]
```
The `rolling()` function creates an [iterator object](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types) over the list (or any other iterable) with a specified window size and reduction operation:
```python
>>> r_sum = rolling(counts, window_size=3, func='Sum') # rolling sum
>>> r_all = rolling(counts, window_size=3, func='All') # rolling all
>>> r_max = rolling(counts, window_size=3, func='Max') # rolling max
```
The result of iterating over each rolling object is shown below:
```python
>>> list(r_sum)
[8, 7, 5]
>>> list(r_all)
[True, False, False]
>>> list(r_max)
[5, 5, 3]
```
As well as the built-in efficient algorithms, any callable Python object can be applied to the rolling window when using the `rolling()` function:
```python
>>> r_list = rolling(counts, window_size=3, func=tuple)
>>> list(r_list)
[(1, 5, 2), (5, 2, 0), (2, 0, 3)]
```

## Installation

There are no library dependencies for running this module.

Currently, the simplest way to install is to clone the repo, change into the new directory, and then use pip:

```
git clone https://github.com/ajcr/rolling.git
cd rolling/
pip install . # to develop, use `pip install -e .`
```

pytest is used for testing. Tests are in the `tests/` directory. To execute all tests, just run `pytest` from the base directory.

## Overview of the Algorithms

### Algorithm complexity

The *rolling* module implements efficient ways of updating a rolling window for a number of common operations.

Suppose the size of the window is **k**. Then the update time and overall space complexity for each algorithm is as follows:

| Operation                | Update Time | Space |
| ------------------------ |:--------:|:-----:|
| Sum                      | O(1)     | O(k)  |
| Mean                     | O(1)     | O(k)  |
| Median*                   | O(log k) | O(k)  |
| Var (Variance)*           | O(1)     | O(k)     |
| Std (Standard Deviation)* | O(1)     | O(k)     |
| Any                      | O(1)     | O(1)  |
| All                      | O(1)     | O(1)  |
| Count                    | O(1)     | O(k)  |
| Min                      | O(1)     | O(k)  |
| Max                      | O(1)     | O(k)  |

### References and resources

Some rolling algorithms are relatively easy to discover. 

After some thought, **Sum** can be computed by keeping track of the two values entering and leaving the window in each iteration, and adding and subtracting these values from the total. **All** just requires tracking whether the count of consecutive 'true' values is greater-than-or-equal-to the size of the window.

However, other rolling algorithms are ingenious and I learned a lot by reading about them. Here are the resources that I used.

- **Max** and **Min** are implemented using the Ascending Minima and Descending Maxima algorithms described by Richard Harter [here](http://www.richardhartersworld.com/cri/2001/slidingmin.html). This algorithm is also used in *pandas* and *bottleneck*. My attention was first drawn to this algorithm by Jaime Fernandez del Rio's excellent talk ['The Secret Life Of Rolling Pandas'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM_r5La-1tA).

- **Median** uses the indexable skiplist approach presented by Raymond Hettinger (cf. [here](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577073/)).

- **Var** and **Std** use [Welford's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#On-line_algorithm). 

## Discussion and Future Work

The algorithms implemented by this module are chosen to be efficient in the sense that the cost of computing each new return value scales well with the size of window.

In theory this is great. In practice you might find that it is quicker *not* to use the supplied 'efficient' algorithm, and instead apply a function to the window. This is especially true for very small window sizes where the cost of updating a window is relatively complex. For instance, while the window size `k` is less than approximately 50, it may quicker to use `rolling(array, k, min)` (apply Python's builtin minimum function) rather than using `rolling(array, k, 'Min')`.

With this in mind, in future it might be worth implementing some of the algorithms here in compiled code (e.g. as a C extension module, or using Cython) to improve speed.

Other work which would extend the usefulness of this module includes:

- Allowing operations on variable-length windows.
- Alternative algorithms that trade time complexity for a reduced memory footprint.
- Additional reduction operations for windows (e.g. longest increasing sequence), and weighted window algorithms.
